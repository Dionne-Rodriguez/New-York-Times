<h2>How It's Made</h2>
Tech used: HTML, CSS

The New York times site was one of the first projects I worked and truly struggled with. I'm glad I worked on it though because it forced me to really practice my craft. In this project I got a good understanding of how to use floats in order to position content and embedding video's.
